# A blog website using Django



This is my first project using Django, initially I was inspired to create a blog website like medium.
I should have realized it was too much for a beginner. Overwhelmed by the idea, I did create a blog website.
In the app: 

- anyone can see blogs of others which has been published
- Likewise, they are able to comment
- a user needs to login to create his own blogs and can also keep them as draft or publish them
- Before a user is able to login, a user profile has to be created providing email and password 
- then an email will be sent on his personal email
- which must be clicked to make the user is actived thus able to login
- if a user wants, he will able to edit a published blog
