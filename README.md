<h2>A blog website using Django</h2>

<pre>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="block two first">
            <p1>The following is a blog website which I created using Django. 
In the blog website, anyone can see blogs of others which has been published. 
Likewise, they are able to comment. However, a user needs to login to create
his own blogs and can also keep them as draft or publish them. Before a user 
is able to login, a user profile has to be created providing certain 
information, then an email will be sent on his personal email, 
which must be clicked to make the user is actived thus able to login.
If a user wants, he will able to edit a published blog.
Feel free to resuse my code and happy if I can contribute somehow.</p2>
